                    <p>In the field of development, language is the base and for that, you need to have a strong command of languages. This is how a backend developer is going to create a solid frame and its connectivity via servers. The desired outputs and functionality will work only if you’ve mastered the backend programming language. There are three major languages that giant IT firms use Java, Python, and PHP.</p>

                    <p>So now you have the basic knowledge of backend programming languages, now it’s your turn to start with basic front-end language. Although it is not mandatory to master it, having basic skills required for this role such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A programmer needs to have the capability to give instructions to computers for communicating and for applying different algorithms. You need to have a good command of basic languages if you’re looking for perfect output via coding.  </p>

                    <p>Once you’ve decided on the language which you need to work on, you need to brush up skills with the framework as well. The framework is a backbone of a language on a program/application on which you’re working. There are certain frameworks that you might consider working on while working as a back-end developer.</p>

                    <p>It is also known as the source control which is responsible for any changes that have to be done from time to time. The version control system tracks every single modification of codes in a different database. This becomes more helpful when a developer makes a mistake and wants to reverse it back and it helps in protecting source code from any such incidents.</p>

                    <p>When you’re working on a project, you must understand that the storage of data is very crucial as they carry a large amount of information. So, it is a must to have a good command over the database. The backend developer is responsible for creating a relational mapping so that the data can be retrieved when required. Thus, to handle DBMS, developers use MySQL, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.</p>

                    <p>Application Programming Interface or API is responsible for establishing connections between different applications. Just take an example, let’s say you are ordering some item from Alibaba via the mobile application, so here you’re establishing a connection with Alibaba’s API. Backend developers use these APIs to establish connections between different applications to enhance user experience. The most popular APIs among developers are JSON, SOAP, REST, GSON, etc.</p>

                    <h2>7. Server Handling</h2>
                    <p>Since backend developers are responsible to perform all the actions behind the curtains so it is a must to have a good command over handling the server. A server is a cloud system that provides all the useful information and offers services such as file storage, database, and security to other systems connected to that network. The details stored in the server are responsible for recovering, rearranging, stored information. Some of the best tools for server handling are Docker, Kubernetes, etc.</p>

                    <p>A good knowledge of DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is also recommended to become a great back-end developer. It is necessary for efficient management and proper retrieval of data in order to prevent any memory leakage. DSA is also important because it forms the base for modifying, organizing, and accessing data in programming. Also, it is important that you learn Data Structure and Algorithms before becoming a back-end developer because it will help to make the code more optimized and efficient.</p>

                    <p>Back-end development can be a tricky business therefore, the person handling it must have problem-solving abilities in order to do the work smoothly. A back-end developer is the backbone of any website as they are the main problem solvers and keep a check if the website is working in a proper manner or not. So if you have a passion for becoming a back-end developer – you can also improve your problem-solving skills as much as you can. </p>

                    <p>Backend development is a task where you need to focus otherwise things can get hampered. So this unique quality of working hard without any distractions can also make you a loner. But communication is the base of this job because you will have to work with a team on multiple projects with fellow developers. You will also have to discuss various ideas, with clients, the manager, or your fellow teammates. Therefore, be prepared to talk with people as it will lead to successful collaborations and projects too. </p>
